# Manim-PKMS
- This repo is my deployment of stufff I have learnt using manim.
- It is made using obsidian.md and https://dg-docs.ole.dev/.

  ### Why?
  - It sorts you knowledge into so called "second-brain" which imo is very cool also it is very easily accessible inside the website so it's fun.
  ### Aim?
  - FUN
