- This was made using [this](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden) template and obsidian.md ofcourse.

 - It is my PKMS for manim, the lib I have a lots of fun with, so in totality it is just a fun lil project.

## Source code for codes used:
- I will be soon uploading in another repo, so you can just clone it and directly use every function you can find on this site, just read from the introduction, the graph will lead you the way!
Cheers!
- But you can always copy the snippets from the site too :).
